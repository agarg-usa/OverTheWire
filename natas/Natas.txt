refer to natas12.php
main exploit is using the fact that XOR inverse is XOR,
so knowing the original data and the final data we can find the key

You can upload a php file, and run remote code execution
ls : http://natas12.natas.labs.overthewire.org/upload/zfj1jokz1z.php
ls ../ : http://natas12.natas.labs.overthewire.org/upload/qziweu00vh.php
pass will prob be in /etc/natas_webpass/natas13
cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas13 : http://natas12.natas.labs.overthewire.org/upload/3n3hwfp7jn.php
Got it!

We can trick php exif_imagetype by adding the png magic header 89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a
the code has an exploit where you can change the filename to be whatever you want, so the extension of the
file when saved will be whatever you want. We can change the extension of the file to be .php, then upload
our suppoused png file (which actually has php code, just has the png magic which will just be rendered as
null characters in the html)

Keep in note: trying to edit the file with anything other than a hexeditor can change the data, removing the
png magic header.

How to figure this out?
on the php documentation on exif_imagetype, it states it finds the image by:
https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.exif-imagetype.php

Description Â¶
exif_imagetype(string $filename): int|false
exif_imagetype() reads the first bytes of an image and checks its signature.
the important part being reads the first bytes of an image and checks its signature.

SQL injection: make password = " UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE NOT username= "asdf

able to use SQL injection to lower down the possiblities when bruteforcing a password

can do RCE using $()
WATCH OUT for spaces, which can mess up the grep (especially since the input is surrounded by " ")
/etc/natas_webpass/natas17

$(cut -c 2 /etc/natas_webpass/natas17), then scan through input and find matching characters.
Might come up with multiple passwords, and would have to bruteforce all the possible passwords

another method is to do
"April$(grep \.{n}*character*.*\)"
where n is the number character you are at. If the character is there, the input will be Aprilasdf which will give no results.
Otherwise if the character does not exist in that n'th spot, the input will just be April which will give results.
second idea is better but I did not think of it

We can use # as a comment
natas18" UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE password LIKE "a%" AND SLEEP(1)  #
natas18" UNION SELECT * FROM users WHERE username="natas18" AND SLEEP(1)  #

you can solve this level by spoofing your PHPSESSION, it only goes up to 640, so just
try all of them
